This program was made as for Week 1 of Coursera's Introduction to Embedded Software and Development environments course. This program takes an array, prints it to the console, finds the mean, median, max, and min, and sorts the array from largest to smallest. This program was writen and compiled on a virtual Ubuntu machine.
